For some reason, the notebook isn't rendered in the github. But if it's downloaded and run in google colab or jupyter notebook, it works correctly.

The dataset "IMDB Dataset.csv" is too heavy to be downloaded to github repository, but it can be downloaded via the link: https://disk.360.yandex.ru/d/dhKpEgM4rQkLiQ
It needs to be added in the same folder, as the notebook, to run it correctly.
